# Email OTP Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ **GOOD NEWS: Emails ARE Being Sent Successfully!**

Your EmailJS integration is working correctly! The logs show:
```
EmailJS API Response: 200 - OK
Email sent successfully via EmailJS API
```

## üîç **Why You Might Not See Emails:**

### 1. **Check Spam/Junk Folder**
- Look in your spam or junk folder
- Add `noreply@emailjs.com` to your contacts/safe senders list

### 2. **Email Delivery Delay**
- Emails can take 1-5 minutes to arrive
- Some email providers have delivery delays

### 3. **Email Provider Filtering**
- Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo may filter automated emails
- Check "All Mail" folder in Gmail

### 4. **EmailJS Template Configuration**
Your current template might need adjustment. Here's what to check:

#### Current Configuration:
- **Service ID**: `service_tlq45us`
- **Template ID**: `template_qvfmfpo`
- **Public Key**: `OM3_KO6jP5ZWzAd6H`

#### Template Variables Being Sent:
- `to_email`: Recipient email
- `to_name`: Recipient name
- `otp_code`: The 6-digit OTP
- `app_name`: Campus Food App
- `from_name`: Campus Food App Team
- `subject`: Verification Code - Campus Food App
- `message`: Email body with OTP

## üõ†Ô∏è **Immediate Solutions:**

### Option 1: Check Your Email
1. Check spam folder for `redv00497@gmail.com`
2. Wait 2-3 minutes and check again
3. Look in "All Mail" if using Gmail

### Option 2: Test with Different Email
Try sending OTP to a different email provider:
- Outlook.com
- Yahoo.com
- iCloud.com

### Option 3: EmailJS Template Verification
1. Go to [EmailJS Dashboard](https://dashboard.emailjs.com)
2. Check your template `template_qvfmfpo`
3. Make sure all template variables are properly configured
4. Test the template with sample data

## üîß **Advanced Solutions:**

### Option 4: Use Alternative Email Service
If EmailJS continues to have delivery issues, consider:
- **SendGrid**: More reliable for transactional emails
- **Mailgun**: Better deliverability
- **AWS SES**: Enterprise-grade email service

### Option 5: EmailJS Template Improvement
Update your EmailJS template to be more email-friendly:

```html
Subject: {{subject}}

Dear {{to_name}},

Your verification code for {{app_name}} is:

**{{otp_code}}**

This code will expire in 10 minutes.

If you did not request this code, please ignore this email.

Best regards,
{{from_name}}
```

## üì± **For Testing:**

The app currently shows OTP in console for testing:
```
=== DEBUG MODE: OTP for redv00497@gmail.com ===
OTP: 552540
Valid for 10 minutes
===============================
```

Use this OTP for immediate testing while troubleshooting email delivery.

## ‚úÖ **Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ EmailJS API: Working (200 OK responses)
- ‚úÖ OTP Generation: Working
- ‚úÖ Email Sending: Working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Email Delivery: May need recipient-side investigation

## üéØ **Next Steps:**
1. Check spam folder for emails
2. Test with different email addresses
3. Verify EmailJS template configuration
4. Consider alternative email service if needed

The system is working correctly - the issue is likely email delivery/visibility, not sending!
